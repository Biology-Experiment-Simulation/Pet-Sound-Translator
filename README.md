# Pet-Sound-Translator (Cats)

## Product Definition
* Product Mission

The goal of this project is to create a pet sound processing software that can identify their positive and negative emotions. Our product can be used by pet owners to have a better understanding of their pets. It can also be used to monitor pets' mood automatically.
* Target Users
* User Stories
* MVP
* User Iterface Design
Our product should be an API or a computer/mobile app that:
 - User can upload cat sound recordings using our interfaces/ User can record live cat sound and upload it to the app.
 - Once the record is uploaded, the user will get a generalized category of catâ€™s emotion corresponding to its sound. 
User Stories
